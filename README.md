# Overview
For this assessment, your goal is to create a solution that visualizes GitHub repository information for the [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft) organization. You will need to use the GitHub API to retrieve data, and then display that data in a list.

# Expectations
Your solution should be written using ASP.NET Core. Feel free to use any other tools and technologies you find useful. While you can spend as much time as you'd like on this, we aren't expecting a production ready solution. Instead, be prepared to describe in person what hardening could be done to ensure maintanability and extendability. Our general recommendation is to spend 2 hours on this test.

# Specifications
- Use the GitHub API to fetch data
- Each repository in your list should include the following:
  - Repository Name
  - Owner's Avatar
  - Subscriber Count
  - Star Count
- Be sure to write your code (both front-end and back-end) in a way that can be extended in the future (for example, if we also wanted to integrate with other platforms such as BitBucket)

# Submission
Push your submission to a branch on this repository with the name `submissions/{your-name}`

# Good Luck!
